This is a 90% rip of Mo Sim, an FRC simualtion software made by MoMachine. 

As this is a 90% rip many things have not been completely fixed or repaired.

  1. Lighting is not in its original state.
  2. Some UI elements may contain temporary sizing elements.
  3. Controllers are not implemented correctly.
       a. Split screen will not work as all robots reference the same button set
       b. Remaping a button will serve no purpose.
  4. Some font sizes have not been corrected and all UI elements use the wrong font.
  5. The physics setting are slightly tweaked (improved joint stability)

Please understand and respect the Sim Developer when making mods based off this and understand this repo and the game may make sudden changes obsoleting all pre-existing mods as the project is still incomplete and missing important elements to reach its goal.
