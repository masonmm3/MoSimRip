This is a 90% rip of vanilla Mo Sim. Mo Simulator is an FRC simualtion software made by MoMachine. 

Beacause this is a 90% rip, the following parts of the game are not fully implemented correctly.

  1. Lighting is not in its original state.
  2. Some UI elements contain temporary sizing elements.
  3. Controllers are not implemented correctly. Split screen will not work as all robots reference the same button set. Remapping buttons does not work.
  4. Some font sizes have not been corrected and all UI elements use the wrong font.
  5. The physics setting are slightly tweaked (improved joint stability)

Please understand and respect the Sim Developer when making mods based off this and understand this repo and the game may make sudden changes obsoleting all pre-existing mods as the project is still incomplete and missing important elements to reach its goal.

Most importantly respect and follow the principle of open source when modding.
